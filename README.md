# Spellcarver Base Images

This repository is maintained by Merlin Mines to provide standardized base container images that support version requirements for the Spellcarver application ecosystem.

## Overview

The Spellcarver Base Images repository contains a collection of carefully curated Docker container images that serve as the foundation for various components of the Spellcarver application. These images are designed to ensure consistent development and deployment environments across the entire platform.

## Security and Updates

Our images are built on the secure Wolfi OS base, a minimalist, security-focused operating system designed specifically for containers. To maintain the highest security standards:

- Images are automatically updated every Friday
- Regular CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) scans and patches
- Compliance updates are applied weekly
- Built on Wolfi OS for enhanced container security and minimal attack surface

## Purpose

- Provide standardized, version-controlled base images
- Ensure compatibility across Spellcarver components
